# Introduction

Cat Bot#4474 is a bot which sends you pictures/videos of cats (mostly) in your discord server. You can customise which channels the bot is allowed to message in

<br>

# Quickstart

**NOTE: You must have the Manage Channels permission to use the channel command**

<br>

Invite the bot to your server and in any channel, enter `c:channel add <channel>`. Now the bot would be able to send messages in that channel. To use the bot, do `c:cat` in that channel. To "allow" more channels, use `/settings`. If that doesn't work, you can manually add them using the `c:channel add <channel>` command. You can do `c:channel list` to view all the allowed channels in the server

<br>

# Commands

The following commands are available:

<br>

`c:?` | `c:h` | `c:help` | `c:list` : Gives you a list of available commands

`c:ping` : Pings the bot and tells you its latency

`c:info` | `c:about` : Tells stuff about the bot

`c:channel help` | `c:channels help` : Shows the commands used to set up this bot

`c:cute` | `c:cat` | `c:ket` : Sends you a pic/vid of a cute animal (mostly cats)

`/help` : Gives you a list of available commands

`/about` : Tells stuff about the bot

`/cat` : Sends you a pic/vid of a cute animal (mostly cats)

`/settings` : Basically `c:channel` but GUI

<br>

Lets explore these commands a bit more

<br>

## Help

`c:help` and `/help` are pretty self explanatory, they just give you a list of all the available commands

## About

`c:about` and `/about` sends you an embed of info about this bot, including support links and statistics of the bot

## Cat

`c:cat`, `c:cute`, `c:ket`, and `/cat` both do the same thing, ie send you a cat pic/vid. To send it, the channel where the command is ran should be an allowed channel. You can also DM the bot `c:cat` to receive a cat pic/vid :)

## Channel/Settings

`c:channel`, `c:channels`, and `/settings` both provide the same functionality, ie providing a way to manage the channels which the bot can send messages in. Here are the parameters you can use in `c:channel` and `c:channels`, you can also view them by doing `c:channel help`

<br>

`c:channel help` : Shows this message

`c:channel <list | ls>` : Shows all the allowed channels in this server

`c:channel allow <channel>` or `c:channel add <channel>` : Allows a channel

`c:channel disallow <channel>` or `c:channel remove <channel>` : Disallows a channel

`c:channel flush` : Removes all the deleted channels from our database
