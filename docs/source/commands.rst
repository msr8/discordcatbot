Lets explore these commands a bit more

<br>

## Help

``c:help`` and ``/help`` are pretty self explanatory, they just give you a list of all the available commands

## About

``c:about`` and ``/about`` sends you an embed of info about this bot, including support links and statistics of the bot

## Cat

``c:cat``, ``c:cute``, ``c:ket``, and ``/cat`` both do the same thing, ie send you a cat pic/vid. To send it, the channel where the command is ran should be an allowed channel. You can also DM the bot ``c:cat`` to receive a cat pic/vid :)

## Channel/Settings

``c:channel``, ``c:channels``, and ``/settings`` both provide the same functionality, ie providing a way to manage the channels which the bot can send messages in. Here are the parameters you can use in ``c:channel`` and ``c:channels``, you can also view them by doing ``c:channel help``

<br>

``c:channel help`` : Shows this message

``c:channel <list | ls>`` : Shows all the allowed channels in this server

``c:channel allow <channel>`` or ``c:channel add <channel>`` : Allows a channel

``c:channel disallow <channel>`` or ``c:channel remove <channel>`` : Disallows a channel

``c:channel flush`` : Removes all the deleted channels from our database
