# Quickstart

**NOTE: You must have the Manage Channels permission to use the channel command**

<br>

Invite the bot to your server and in any channel, enter `c:channel add <channel>`. Now the bot would be able to send messages in that channel. To use the bot, do `c:cat` in that channel. To "allow" more channels, use `/settings`. If that doesn't work, you can manually add them using the `c:channel add <channel>` command. You can do `c:channel list` to view all the allowed channels in the server
