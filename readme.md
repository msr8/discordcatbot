Cat Bot#4474 is a bot which sends you pictures/videos of cats (mostly) in your discord server when you want. You can customise which channels the bot is allowed to message in. Currently, there are 1500+ pictures and videos in my collection

# Quickstart

**NOTE: You must have the Manage Channels permission to use the channel command**

<br>

Invite the bot to your server and in any channel, enter `c:channel add <channel>`. Now the bot would be able to send messages in that channel. To use the bot, do `c:cat` in that channel. To "allow" more channels, use `/settings`. If that doesn't work, you can manually add them using the `c:channel add <channel>` command. You can do `c:channel list` to view all the allowed channels in the server

<br>

If you're still having issues, please watch the [tutorial](https://github.com/msr8/msr8.github.io/blob/main/discordcatbot-media/Discord%20Cat%20Bot%20Final.mov?raw=true) and read the [documentation](https://msr8.github.io/discordcatbot) once
