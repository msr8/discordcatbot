# Introduction

This is a WIP (Work in progress) discord bot that sends a random cute animal (mostly cats) when you do `c:cat` or `c:cute` or `c:ket`. You can control which channels the bot can send the media in using `c:channel`. I plan to get it fully up and running soon, so if you're intersted in adding this bot to your server, be sure to star this repository!

# To-Do

- [x] Add the abilty to send the media in DMs
