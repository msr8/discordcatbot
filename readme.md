# Introduction
This is a WIP (Work in progress) discord bot that sends a random cute animal pic (mostly a cat) every hour. I plan to get it fully up and running within 2 weeks, so if you're intersted in adding this bot to your server, be sure to star this repository!

<br>

# To-Do
1) Change the method the channel data is stored because I plan to use Heroku to run my bot 24/7

2) Make a proper documentation/guide on how to use it

3) Get it up and running

4) Register it on sites like top.gg

5) Add abilty to send the media in DMs

# PLEASE READ: Due to external circumstances, I won't be able to work on this bot for ~3 months, sorry for the delay
